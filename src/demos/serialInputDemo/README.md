# Serial Input Demonstration

This class is simply used to demonstrate handling @ref Serial input. In the case of this example, the input is generated by user input. In the real world, this could be a user or another device.  This When entering text for this code to parse and echo back, be sure to wrap it in `<` and `>`.  This code was originally published on the Arduino forum at [**this link**](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/serial-input-basics-updated/382007/2#example-3-a-more-complete-system-1).

For a full write up and explanation of the @ref Serial concepts demonstrated here, please refer to the source article.  If you're using VSCode, it's easiest to test with the @link "Serial Monitor" Extension, by Microsoft:
